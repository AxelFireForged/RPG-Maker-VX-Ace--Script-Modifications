# RPG-Maker-VX-Ace--Script-Modifications
This Repository features RPGM VXA scripts that I modified for my projects, wether theyâ€™re pre-established scrips made by others or base RPG Maker VXA modifications done by me.

I mainly do this for more customization features that I see fit. 
Can never go wrong with more customization!

Important Note:

My terms of use are just simply provide credit to me
a simple Axel FireForged in a readme or credits works.

Otherwise. Follow other people's terms of use. 
I am modifying their stuff after all.
